*Thus, I claim that I am not an enemy of Higher Education. But I am an enemy of Higher Education as it is given in this country. Under my scheme, there will be more and better libraries, more and better laboratories, more and better research institutes. Under it, we should have an army of chemists, engineers and other experts who will be real servants of the nation and answer the varied and growing requirements of people who are becoming increasingly conscious of their rights and wants. And all these experts will speak, not a foreign language, but the language of the people. The knowledge gained by them will be the common property of the people. There will be truly original work instead of mere imitation. And the cost will be evenly and justly distributed.*

-Harijan : 9 July 1938
